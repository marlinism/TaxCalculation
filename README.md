# TaxCalculation
***Context***: Tax is one of the most confusing problem for not only me, but most of Americans. Therefore, I created the tax calculation app that I can calculate the tax that a single person has to pay each year.

***Software***: Core Java
          
I first finished the class for rate calculation, then used JavaSwing to finish the front-end of the app.

***Output***: It runs successfully with different kind of tests.
